The JavaScript provides you the facility to validate the form on the client side so processing will be fast than server-side validation. So, most of the web developers prefer JavaScript form validation.

Through JavaScript, we can validate name, password, email, date, mobile number etc fields.

JavaScript form validation example
In this example, we are going to validate the name, password, confirm a password, mobile number and Email. The name can’t be empty and password can’t be less than 6 characters long.

Here, we are validating the form on form submit. The user will not be forwarded to the next page until given values are correct.

JavaScript Number Validation
Let's validate the text field for numeric value only. Here, we are using isNaN() function.

There are many criteria that need to be followed to validate the email id such as:

email id must contain the @ and . character
There must be at least one character before and after the @.
There must be at least two characters and atmost 3 characters after . (dot).
